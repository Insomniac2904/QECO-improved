## Future Directions


- Addressing **single-agent non-stationarity issues** by leveraging **multi-agent DRL**.
- **Accelerating the learning of optimal offloading policies** by taking advantage of **Federated Learning** techniques in the training process. This will allow MDs to collectively contribute to improving the offloading model and enable continuous learning when new MDs join the network.
- Addressing partially observable environment issues by designing a decentralized **Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP)**.
- Extending the **Task Models** by considering interdependencies among tasks. This can be achieved by incorporating a **Task Call Graph Representation**.
- Implementation of the D3QN algorithm using **PyTorch**, focusing on efficient **parallelization** and enhanced model stability.
